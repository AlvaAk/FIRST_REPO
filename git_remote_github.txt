SSH KEY IN GIT HUB

================

Cloning the repository is no different than usual, but obtaining permission to write back into that repository on GitHub is slightly more complex, because in order to authenticate to GitHub you must have an SSH key. If you're on Linux, create one with this command:

$ ssh-keygen

Then copy your new key, which is plain text. You can open it in a plain text editor, or use the cat command:

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now paste your key into GitHub's SSH configuration,  or your GitLab configuration.

As long as you clone your GitHub project via SSH, you'll be able to write back to your repository.

Alternately, you can use GitHub's file uploader interface to add files without even having Git on your system.
